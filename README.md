# 🍴 Khedma Tayba – Food Delivery App

Khedma Tayba is a **modern food delivery mobile app** built with **Flutter**, designed from a professional **Figma UI design**.  
This project demonstrates my ability to implement **beautiful modern app designs**, create **scalable Flutter code**, and build apps that could be extended into production-ready products.  

It was developed as a **personal project** to showcase my mobile development skills.
